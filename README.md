## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A predictable state container for Javascript apps
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Prop Types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) - Runtime type checking for React props
- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - Generation of RFC4122 UUIDs

### What I learned


This project was very useful for me, specially because i learned how to create sliders and implement them on mobile.
It was also helpful to reinforce my knowledge on responsive design, react portals and context  api.

### Useful resources

- [React GH Pages Tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) - This was an amazing resource that helped me to host my react application on github pages. Since github use a different approach to host their pages, a create-react-app can't be hosted natively on github pages, so i had to use the gh-pages library to help me deploy an app on a different branch that is ready to be published.
